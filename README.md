# MUSIC PLAYER APP


## How it's made. 

**Tech Used**: HTML | CSS | JAVASCRIPT |
I wanted to make a spotify clone but dicided to move on to other projects. Will revisit in the future as this app has a lot of working functionality as is.

## Optimizations
In the future, it would be nice to optimize a few things
- increase overall speed on clicks and loads
- include user preferences with more MongoDB backend
- add additional search features
- take the preferences of the user and use that to build recommendations 


## Lessons Learned
I learned the importance of seperation of information. Im happy with how this turned out for now.
